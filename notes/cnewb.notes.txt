encodings: Embeddings
VisionNet: Phase 2 neural network that assigns labels to embeddings (embedding -> employee ID)



------ class files ------
neuralNetwork: The ANN class file
faceEncoding: The faceEncoder class file (wrapper class to generate face embeddings)
------ utilities ------
generateEncodings: Uses faceEncoding to generate embeddings for provided faces
generateVisionNet: Uses neuralNetwork to generate and test a model of face encodings (embeddings)
------ application ------
visionAPI: Simple class combining neuralNetwork and faceEncoding into a simple to use library used to train, append, and predict faces.
visionServer: Web server that provides a REST API for web users to interact with the vision API.
