Goal: A system that can clock a worker in and out using their face.


End-goal:

	A worker stands in front of a camera, "initiates"/activates the system (double blink), system captures the picture of the worker and then clocks them in or out for work.

	The problem with using some action for activating the system, such as double blink, our system would be required to process a video stream. This would add processing overhead.
	Another option that could completely by-pass this would have the worker click/tap a button to activate the system instead, drastically reducing system processing.
